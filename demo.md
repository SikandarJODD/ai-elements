Easyyy

Complex Part :
- structure files, so it would be helpful for developers to view clearly what are new changes
- highlight important code
- small docs in right corner - what we are using in code like generate text, stream text, if using any mistral models, or interference - web search

- i need to buy some credits to use more models and functionality - like
- web search : boolean
- pass models to server.ts
- image generation aren't free - this one is imp
- image analysis in future

- make a nice plan
- structure code, docs, demos
